    "To get airline delay data for your machine learning project from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visit the BTS website**: The Bureau of Transportation Statistics provides publicly accessible data on airline performance, including delays. You can access the data at [https://www.transtats.bts.gov](https://www.transtats.bts.gov).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Access the Data**: \n",
    "   - On the BTS homepage, navigate to the **\"Data\"** section, and find **\"Airline On-Time Performance Data\"**.\n",
    "   - Alternatively, directly visit the [Airline On-Time Performance page](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp) where they provide datasets that include delay times, reasons for delays, and other relevant details.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Download Data**: \n",
    "   - You can download the data in formats like CSV or Excel. Choose the data you need (e.g., monthly or annual data) and the relevant airline or flight information.\n",
    "   - If you need historical data, you can filter by specific months or years.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **API Access (Optional)**: \n",
    "   - If you prefer programmatic access, BTS provides a **RESTful API** to query the data. This can be useful if you need to automate data fetching for your machine learning project. You can find more about the API on their website: [https://www.bts.gov/developer](https://www.bts.gov/developer).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Prepare Data for ML**: Once you've downloaded the data, you'll need to clean and preprocess it. This may involve handling missing data, transforming categorical variables (e.g., airline codes), and normalizing the time data before using it in your machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you can easily gather the airline delay data you need for your machine learning project."
